# Hybrid Network Topology using Scilab

This repository contains Scilab programs for creating and visualizing
network topologies as part of a Computer Networks laboratory exercise.

## Objective
To design and implement a hybrid network topology using basic network
topologies and perform various operations such as visualization,
node and edge numbering, colouring, and analysis.

## Topologies Used
- Star Topology
- Ring Topology
- Bus Topology

These basic topologies are interconnected to form a hybrid network
topology with a minimum of 25 nodes.

## Software Used
- Scilab 6.0.0

## Description
A hybrid network topology with 29 nodes is created by combining Star,
Ring, and Bus topologies. The program displays the created topology,
numbers and colours the nodes and edges, calculates the degree of each
node, identifies the node with the maximum number of connections, and
prints the total number of nodes and edges.

## Files Included
- `hybrid_topology.sce` – Scilab program for hybrid topology creation

## Output
- Graphical display of the hybrid network topology
- Console output showing total nodes, total edges, and node degrees
